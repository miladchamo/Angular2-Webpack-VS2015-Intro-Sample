# Angular2-Webpack-VS2015-Intro-Sample
Setting up Angular 2 webpack in VS 2015, based on the angular.io webpack intro docs, which can be found at https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/webpack.html.  Currently, it appears that these docs are incorrect, as following the steps results in build errors.

I've also reported this issue in the following thread: https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/3227.
